# FaceDetectionComparator
Face detection is an AI-based computer technology that can identify and locate the presence of human faces in digital photos and videos.<br> It can be regarded as a special case of object-class detection, where the task is to find the locations and specify the sizes of all the objects that belong to a given class - in this case, faces - within a specific image or images. <br>Face detection technology can be applied to various fields - including security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment and personal safety - to provide surveillance and tracking of people in real time.<br> Face detection models often represents the basis for other computer vision approaches, such as face recognition, age estimation or face expression prediction. <br>
In this project, my goal is to draw bounding boxes on faces using pre-trained models like Haar cascades, MTCNN, cvlib and a Caffe model using OpenCVâ€™s DNN module. Then I will compare them to find out which works the best for real-time applications.
